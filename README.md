# Mural

Based on the classic Mapbox Streets style, the *Mural* style aims for awesome
looking print maps of urban centers and their surroundings.

Streets Mural uses Mapbox Streets v7 as its data source. Most changes to the
\#road layer have been ported from v5.

## Limitations
* Uses only German symbols for public transportation
* Not optimized for zoom levels lower than 14
* Not intended to be used as a theme for scrollable maps.
* Many small annoyances and many hacks
